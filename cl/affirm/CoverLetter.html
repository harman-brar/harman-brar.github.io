    <p><strong><u>Re: Application to Software Engineer Intern Position</strong></u> </p>

    <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

<p>After reading about how Affirmâ€™s drive to revolutionize the banking industry is allowing consumers to feel more confident managing their finances and making purchases, I am thrilled to have the opportunity to join the team at Affirm whose work has an impact on such a fundamental aspect of everyday life, for so many people. I believe with my previous experience developing web-applications as a member of UBC Sailbot, at hackathons, and for personal projects, alongside a strong foundation in object-oriented programming principles developed over years of practice and schooling (and a couple of published android apps), as well as my passion for solving complex problems, I will be able to seamlessly join the team and quickly contribute to the production of high quality software.</p>

<p>While developing, testing, and optimizing, in Node.js/Express and React, the UBC Sailbot web-app over the past six months, I have become extremely confident in my ability to design server architecture, tackle complex end-to-end problems, and present elegant solutions. I have also implemented APIs on various other occasions, such as during NWHacks 2019 at UBC, where my task included incorporating data from external APIs and pushing information to the frontend, as well as testing to ensure the reliability of the server. </p>

    <p>I believe my ability to communicate is one of my strongest skills. I have spent years as a part of numerous sports teams and various clubs. More recently, I spent the previous summer working in the Momose Laboratory at UBC where, alongside my technical tasks, I was responsible for communicating effectively with other researchers in the group in order to ensure that all collaboration was coordinated and organized.</p>

    <p>I am very excited to learn more about this role and further share how my technical and communication skills will be a great fit with the team at Affirm. Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p><strong>Harman Brar</strong></p>
