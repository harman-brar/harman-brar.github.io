    <p><strong><u>Re: Application to Software Developer Co-op/Intern Position</strong></u> </p>

    <p>Dear Ms. Assimes,</p>

<p>
  After reading about Visierâ€™s desire to turn data into actionable knowledge, I am
  thrilled to have the opportunity to join the team at Visier whose work has an
  impact on such a grand scale. I believe with my previous experience working on
  (web) applications on various occasions, such as with UBC Sailbot, my recent use
  of Selenium for browser automation, as well as my tenacious work ethic and
  passion for solving complex problems, I will be able to seamlessly join the team
  and quickly contribute to the production of high quality software.
</p>

<p>
  While developing and optimizing, in Node.js/Express and React, the UBC Sailbot
  web-app over the past few months, I have become extremely confident in my
  ability to tackle complex end-to-end problems, and present elegant solutions. I
  have also developed web applications on numerous other occasions, such as
  during NWHacks 2019 at UBC, where my task included incorporating data from
  external APIs and pushing information to the frontend.
</p>

    <p>
      I believe my ability to communicate is one of my strongest skills. I have spent
      years as a part of numerous sports teams and various clubs. More recently, I spent
      the previous summer working in the Momose Laboratory at UBC where, alongside
      my technical tasks, I was responsible for communicating effectively with other
      researchers in the group in order to ensure that all collaboration was coordinated
      and organized.
    </p>

    <p>I am very excited to learn more about this role and further share how my technical
and communication skills will be a great fit with the team at Visier. Thank you for
taking the time to consider my application. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>
