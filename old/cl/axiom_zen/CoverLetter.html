    <p><strong>Hiring Manager</strong></p>
    <p>Axiom Zen</p>
    <p>B1 - 788 Beatty St.</p>
    <p>Vancouver, BC V6B 2M1</p>

    <br>

    <p><strong><u>Re: Application to Back-end Engineering Intern Position</strong></u> </p>

    <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

<p>
      After reading about Axiom Zenâ€™s focus on emerging technologies and drive to
      push the envelope of the latest existing technologies, I am thrilled to have the
      opportunity to join the team at Axiom Zen whose work has an impact on such a
      grand scale. I believe with my previous experience working on (web) applications,
      such as with UBC Sailbot, solid understanding of software design principles, as
      well as my tenacious work ethic and passion for solving complex problems, I will
      be able to seamlessly join the team and quickly contribute to the production of
      high quality software.
    </p>

<p>
      While developing and optimizing the UBC Sailbot web-app in a Linux environment,
      using Node.js/Express and React, these past few months, I have become
      extremely confident in my ability to tackle complex end-to-end problems, and
      present elegant solutions. I have also developed RESTful APIs on numerous other
      occasions, such as during NWHacks 2019 at UBC, where my task included
      incorporating data from external APIs and pushing information to the frontend.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe my ability to communicate is one of my strongest skills. I have spent
      years as a part of numerous sports teams and various clubs. More recently, I spent
      the previous summer working in the Momose Laboratory at UBC where, alongside
      my technical tasks, I was responsible for communicating effectively with other
      researchers in the group in order to ensure that all collaboration was coordinated
      and organized.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am very excited to learn more about this role and further share how my technical
      and communication skills will be a great fit with the team at Axiom Zen. Thank you
      for taking the time to consider my application. I look forward to hearing from you.
    </p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>
